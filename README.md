# IntelliJIdeaKeymap4Eclipse
Provides IntelliJ IDEA key bindings for Eclipse

The goal is to map all shortcuts from [IntelliJ IDEA ReferenceCard.pdf](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/intellij-idea/docs/IntelliJIDEA_ReferenceCard.pdf) until mid January.

At the moment the focus is on Windows.
